# thenewteam is building a real estate app for urban lagos, leveraging AR and a virtual estate agent.

## Inspiration. It was inspired by the stress myself and other people have had to go through renting apartments in lagos 

### What it does
Basically it allows you to rent apartments in lagos using the virtual estate agent instead of the physical ones. And you get to view the interior of the apartment using AR

#### How I built it
It's currently still in the works, but a mobile app is been built with it's landing page on the web.


The landing page is online here https://atanda1.github.io/thenewteam/

And the mobile app prototype is on my team mate's repo https://github.com/Drgleave/newhome/
